Description: simple daemon to store text strings and small files
 The server is a multi thread XML-RPC daemon with a very simple API to
 store and retrieve textual data like configuration settings or passwords and
 small binary files in a centralized manner.
 To access data, user credentials are authenticated against a ldap server to
 allow read/write permissions only to authorized users and groups.
 The daemon no provides SSL encryption by itself, so it binds only to localhost interface.
 SSL functionality is done with the help of stunnel4 network wrapper.
