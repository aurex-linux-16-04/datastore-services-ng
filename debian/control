Description: simple daemon to store text strings and small files
 The server is a multi thread XML-RPC daemon with a very simple API to
 store and retrieve textual data like configuration settings or passwords and
 small binary files in a centralized manner.
 To access data, user credentials are authenticated against a ldap server to
 allow read/write permissions only to authorized users and groups.

 SSL functionality can be easily done with the help of stunnel4 network wrapper.
